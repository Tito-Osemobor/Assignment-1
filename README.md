# ECommerceSystem This was the major project for my CPS-209 over the 2022 Winter which simulates a simple ECommerce System
-> Some features include:
  1. Create and delete customer profiles which includes their names and addresses. 
  2. Customers can order a number of items. 
  3. Customers can cancel an order. 
  4. You can add new products to be purchased. 
  5. When a product is purchased its stock reduces. 
  etc....
